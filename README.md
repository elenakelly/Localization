• Point-based features </br>
• No walls, no collision with features</br>
• Omnidirectional sensor for feature detection</br>
• Limited sensor range</br>
• Bearing and distance estimate</br>
• Known correspondence</br>
• Velocity-based motion model (𝑢 = 𝑣, 𝜔 𝑇)</br>
• Control robot with key board (W=increment 𝑣, S=decrement 𝑣, A=decrement 𝜔 D=increment 𝜔, X=stop)</br>
• Track pose with Kalman Filter</br>
– Drive robot inside field with landmarks</br>
– Demonstrate what happens if no landmarks are visible to robot</br>
– Demonstrate what happens if 3 landmarks are visible to robot</br>
– Experiment with quality of sensors and motion control (noise)</br>
– Make sure to show proper visualization so we can see output of covariance matrices</br>
